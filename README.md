The project is called **FC Brainy**. It is a simple flashcard learning app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is to help students and learners practice questions and answers in an easy way. Each card shows a question on the front and when you click it, the card flips to show the answer.  

The app allows you to add your own flashcards, delete them when not needed, and move between cards using next and previous buttons. A progress indicator shows which card you are on out of the total deck.  

The design is clean and modern, with a transparent glass style card and a subtle background. It is lightweight, interactive, and easy to use. This project is useful for students, teachers, or anyone who wants to learn and revise topics quickly.
